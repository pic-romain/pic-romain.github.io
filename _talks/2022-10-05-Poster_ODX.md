**Introduction** Oncotype DX (ODX) is a multi-gene expression signature for *breast cancer* that provides prognostic and predictive breast cancer recurrence information for estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and HER2 negative patients.  This test can predict if a chemotherapy treatment would be beneficial. However, this test is *expensive* and several studies have shown its link with certain clinico-pathological data. The result of the test is a score between 0 and 100 and guides clinicians regarding *prescription of chemotherapy*  (e.g. for score higher than 25).  
*Aim* - Predict the ODX score absed on histopathological variables.  
*Proposed methodology* - Probabilistic forecast using Distributional Regression Forest (DRF).

This poster was presented at the [Journées Math Bio Santé 2022](https://jmbs2022.sciencesconf.org/) workshop.
